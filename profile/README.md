# Hive Of Things

## Introduction
The Hive Of Things connects and shares IoT devices, services and users in a secure manner. 

The Hive consists of a Hub to which IoT devices, Services and Consumers connect. 
For security reasons the IoT devices and services remain hidden from each other and the outside world. 
All access is routed via the Hub which implements stringent security measures.

The status of the project is in-development. Currently the work focuses on improving compliance with the W3C WoT standard.
